  <meta name="author" content="Morgan Gleason">
    <p>The Jackson Libraryâ€™s website is divided into three main sections</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Searching Information</li>
          <li>Available Resources</li>
          <li>News and Information</li>
        </ul>



<p>The search tab is at eye level when the page opens and clearly shows all of the available search features. This shows that the website is built for students who want to do self guided research. There are clearly labeled help and research guide tabs that users can click on to gain help in searching for information. The website then shows the user technology and study space available if they were to come into the library. They provide technology and study space for users and offer reservations for several of those offerings on their website. </p>

<p>The news and information section of the website was fairly bare and did not seem to be used as much. Overall the website seems to be there to assist users in researching and finding information, whether that information is online or a physical item that the library has. The list of available academic journals is just under the search bar, as is a research guide. All these things make the site fairly easy to use and even if you are not really sure what you are doing, there are several step by step guides on research assistance and a chat feature that allows users to chat with a librarian if they have a question or are lost in the process. It makes it easier to find and utilize what the library has to offer, which is what the website seems designed to do.
